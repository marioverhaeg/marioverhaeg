Hi, I'm Mario, and I'm trying to automate my life. I'm doing this by building a digital twin of my home using several sensors, including several Shelly devices, Raspberry Pi's, UniPi PLCs, IP Cameras, and others. I'm storing the data generated by these sensors in an InfluxDB database and build small microservices that use sensor data to reach a specific goal. ArangoDB serves as a configuration database and I'm using the latest .NET (Core) version as a development platform.

NOTE: I'm not a professional developer. The code I publish works for my specific purpose. Feel free to download a copy and adjust it for your purpose. Please let me know if you have any questions!
